    <h2 class="title">The Louvre by Lorde</h2>
    <article class="louvre">
      <p>Well, summer slipped us underneath her tongue
Our days and nights are perfumed with obsession
Half of my wardrobe is on your bedroom floor
Use our eyes, throw our hands overboard
I am your sweetheart psychopathic crush
Drink up your movements, still I can't get enough
I overthink your punctuation use
Not my fault, just a thing that my mind do
A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame
All that you're doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Our thing progresses
I call and you come through
Blow all my friendships
To sit in hell with you
But we're the greatest
They'll hang us in the Louvre
Down the back, but who caresâ€”still the Louvre
Okay I know that you are not my type
(still I fall)
I'm just the sucker who let you fill her mind
(but what about love?)
Nothing wrong with it
Supernatural
Just move in close to me, closer, you'll feel it coasting
A rush at the beginning
I get caught up, just for a minute
But lover, you're the one to blame
All that you're doing
Can you hear the violence?
Megaphone to my chest
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it
Broadcast the boom, boom, boom, boom
And make 'em all dance to it</p></article>

<h2 class="borns">American Money by Borns</h2>
<article class="americanmoney">
  <p>I was there when you fell from the clouds
And landed in the desert
There was a thunder inside of my heart
There was a wonderful pleasure
And like a stallion racing the rain
You rode on the back of my bike
I knew from the song that you sang
You were my lover for life
Oh, there's no time to sleep
Oh, living in a dream
So take me to the paradise
It's in your eyes
Green like american money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey
And we can run away
Swimming in the sunlight everyday
Paradise, it's in your eyes
Green like american money
So we took to the Calico road
Running from the weather
There was a highway inside of her eyes
There was a buried treasure
And we got caught in the storm
You started flying a kite
At the end was the key to my heart
You were my lover for life
Oh, there's no time to sleep
Oh, living in a dream
So take me to the paradise
It's in your eyes
Green like american money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey
And we can run away
Swimming in the sunlight everyday
Paradise, it's in your eyes
Green like american money
We carved our love in the mountainside
We soaked our hearts in the rain
And I, waited my whole life, for you
So take me to the paradise
It's in your eyes
Green like american money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey
And we can run away
Swimming in the sunlight everyday
Paradise, it's in your eyes
Green like american money</p></article>
